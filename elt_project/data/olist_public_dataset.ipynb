    "# Brazilian Ecommerce Public Dataset by Olist\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome! This is a Brazilian ecommerce public dataset dataset revolving around orders made at [Olist Store](http://www.olist.com). The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018. Its 21 supportive features allows viewing an order from multiple dimensions: from order status, price and freight performance to customer location, product attributes and finally reviews written by customers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is real commercial data, it has been anonymized, and references to the companies and partners in the review text have been replaced with the names of Game of Thrones great houses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Context\n",
    "This dataset was generously provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a customer purchase the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer receives a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and leave some text comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Datasets\n",
    "We are releasing two independent datasets intended for different types of studies. Each row in those datasets corresponds to a customer order, product and review.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Attention**\n",
    "1. Note that a comment may be repeated if an order has two or more different products. \n",
    "1. An order may also be fullfiled by more than one seller if the customer purchases mor than one product.\n",
    "1. Some review comments had personal data like phone numbers, so we did a regex search replacing every group of 3 numbers by '000'. This may mess up with some data other than phone numbers in the comments.\n",
    "1. All text identifying stores and partners where replaced by the names of Game of Thrones great houses.\n",
    "\n",
